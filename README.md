## I :hearts: `Fractals`

![Sample Fractal](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Mandel_zoom_00_mandelbrot_set.jpg)


I have a fascination with fractals and believe that the `great codebases are beautiful fractals`. 
For example; a typical webpage is made up of various cards for different sections and a developer shall arrange them with proper spacing and manipulate cards' content.
Further, `each card, each small animation` on the card is built by doing a smaller version of the same exercise. 
Diving deeper; one shall reach the code which makes the `fonts & dots` appear on the screen, which is again the similar exercise like CSS + HTML (in form vector-images).


**Similar observations can be made about:**
- APIs: which are built on top of APIs.
- Compiler: They are built by themselves. And can grow new features which are represented in patterns of old features.
- The linux operating system is a massive fractal of packages; which are built by assembling smaller ones.
- The concept of layering in networking is a very regular & well formed fractal! 
- The deeper you zoom into how code for a GET request --> firmware on motherboard; there is a similar pattern of bits being munged in the computing architecture.
- Is it just me; or the very nature of neural networks' layers are arranged like a fractal?
